        Crispy deep-fried tofu if one of my favorites. Agedashi Tofu is a popular appetizer you can find at izakaya 
        and Japanese restaurants. It requires deep-frying, but the process is easier than you think. 
        It can easily be converted to be vegetarian and vegan-friendly.
    
    <p>There are a wide range of possible toppings for the fried tofu, making it flexible as well as cheap. </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Drain the tofu for 15 minutes. Don’t drain too long if you want the soft velvety texture on the inside.</li>
        <li>While your tofu drains, pour some tsuyu into a small bowl, and prepare your breading. 
            I like a ratio of 1-to-1 with the panko and potato starch. </li>
        <li>Cut the tofu block into 2 laterally, then cut pieces (roughly 1.5-2 inch squares)</li>
        <li>dip pieces into the tsuyu then and coat them with breading</li>
        <li>Deep fry the tofu for 2 minutes until lightly browned and drain the excess oil.</li>
        <li>top with mayo and garnish, then serve hot!</li>
    </ol>
